# eslint-config-team23-ts

A set of eslint rules used by TEAM23 for standard ts projects

## Installation in your project
Add the library to your `package.json` as `devDependency`

```json
"eslint-config-team23-ts": "git+https://gitlab+deploy-token-XY:DEPLOY_TOKEN_PW@git.team23.de/team23/eslint-config-team23-ts.git#v1.0.5",
```

### Usage in your project

If you've enabled `eslint` locally within your project, just set your `.eslintrc.[json|js]` config to extend the rules from this repo:

#### Extend Globally
```json
{
    "extends": "eslint-config-team23-ts"
}
```

#### Extend overrides
```json
{
    "overrides": [
        {
            "files": [
                "*.ts",
                "*.tsx"
            ],
            "extends": [
                "eslint-config-team23-ts"
            ],
            rules: {}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Extending the .eslintrc.json

Simply add a `"rules"` key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

```json
{
    "extends": "eslint-config-team23-ts"
    "rules": {
        "@typescript-eslint/naming-convention": "off"
    }
}
```
